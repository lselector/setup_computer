Recent MacOS wants password to be at least 8 chars,
have digits and characters, no repeated or consecutive chars,
and wants to change the password every 90 days.

Below is the procedure to shorten the password.

Note: you should still remember the original long password
(or keep it saved somewhere) because this is the password
iCLoud remembers from when you activate your computer.
So in certain situations you may be asked to enter it.

Note: you will have to repeat this procedure from time to time as needed.
(usually once in several months after some upgrades).


OK, so here is how to set the short password.
You can even make it just one charactger!

In Terminal:

1.
pwpolicy getaccountpolicies > ~/Desktop/file.plist
cp ~/Desktop/file.plist ~/Desktop/file.plist.orig

2.
Edit file ~/Desktop/file.plist

    Delete the first line, which says "Getting global account policies"

    Then do changes (from - to) as following:
    
    from:  <string>policyAttributePassword matches '.{8,}'</string>
    to:    <string>policyAttributePassword matches '.{1,}'</string>
    
    for policyAttributeExpiresEveryNDays
    from: <integer>90</integer>
    to:   <integer>3000</integer>
    
    for policyContent 
    from: <string>policyAttributePassword matches '^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).+'</string>
    to  : <string>policyAttributePassword matches '^(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).+'</string>
    
    for policyAttributePasswordHistoryDepth
    from: <integer>5</integer>
    to:   <integer>1</integer>

Save the changes

3.
pwpolicy setaccountpolicies ~/Desktop/file.plist

4. 
Change password
  Old Password: passlong
  New Password: passshort
  Retype New Password: passshort

5.
update the login keychain password by running this command:

security set-keychain-password
  Old Password: passlong
  New Password: passshort
  Retype New Password: passshort
