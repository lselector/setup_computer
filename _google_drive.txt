Instructions for using Google Drive on Lev's Mac
Updated October 27, 2022

Install and start Google Drive app

I use two Google drives: personal and business

Then I create $HOME/docs and $HOME/docs_bb symbolic links as following:

cd $HOME
ln -s "$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-lev.selector@gmail.com/My Drive" docs
ln -s "$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-lev@bixbeta.com" docs_bb

When Google Drive works - it shows an icon in top menu.
Click on it, click on Gear icon, Select Preferences.
A Preferences window will open up.
On The left it will show two choices:
    My MacBook Pro (Folders from your computer)
    Google Drive   (Folders from Drive)

Select Google Drive option.

On the left it will show two options: Stream Files and Mirror Files.
Click on "Mirror files" to keep files in both places
   (on the internet and on local drive)

Click on settings (gear icon on the top right of this window).
Here you can configure both accounts (personal and BixBeta).

Green Checkboxes and cloud download icons in Finder

If you see a cloud download icon next to a file or directory,
this means that the files were not downloaded.

Files with extensions gdoc, gsheet, gslides 
live only in the clowd. They can not be synced.
So there is no green checkboxfor them.

For other files they may be synced to local drive.
You need to right-click on directory - and choose "Available offline".

You will see green check-marks appearing to indicate
that the files or folders were synced.

If there are problems - click on the drive icon on 
the top ment and check if the application is busy.
It may be slow (depends on internet speed).
It may get stuck, and you may need to close it,
and then reopen. Give it some time to fix itself.

On some directories the white cloud download icon may still persist.
This may be caused by the drive being busy sinking.
You may need to give it some time, and then in Finder leave the 
directory - and return into it.

This may be also caused by some sync problem in subfolders. 
You will have to go deep manually in Finder 
and sync piece by piece until you will locate the offending file.

Sometimes green check-marks are missing - and the files 
were indeed NOT downloaded. So in terminal you can see 
their sizes as zero. And when you do right-click 
in Finder - and choose "Available offline", 
they will get downloaded.

Sometimes green check-marks are missing - but the
file is actually synced OK. You may still make the green 
mark appear by right-click - "Available offline"

When you do this "offline" operation on a folder, 
it may travel into the folder, or not. 
So sometimes you will need to enter this folder,
and repeat the "Available offline" from inside the folder.
etc. etc.

Sometimes you see the green marks - and then they suddenly 
vanish without any reason. So you may need to wait and then
leave the directory - and return. They may re-appear.
You may need to repeat the "Available offline" action.

Check settings in System Preferences > Extensions
  for Finder and Google Drive
=============================================
It is NOT recommended for two people to open 
the same document like MS Word or PPT at the same
time, because it takes time to sync,
so person A and person B may have different versions.
And what will be saved depends on the order of saving 
and syncing.
