You can host a free non-commercial website on GitHub.
Just one.

It is easy to do.

Suppose your GitHub account is "myaccount", 
so that your repositories are here:
    https://github.com/myaccount

# ----------------------------------------------------
First create a repository "myaccount.github.io"
(be careful - it ends in "io", not "com").

Next, put there your html pages. 
For example, put there a simple file "index.html" :

<html>
Simple test
</html>

Then you can access it as a web site like this:

    myaccount.github.io

# ----------------------------------------------------
Now suppose you want to use a custom domain "mydomain.com".

You register this domain at Google domains.

# ---------------------------
Then you go to your accounts at domains.google.com
and manage this domain like this:

  you select to use Default name servers,

  and then add 5 DNS records like this:

Hostname          Type     TTL      Data
mydomain.com       A      1 hour    185.199.108.153
                                    185.199.109.153
                                    185.199.110.153
                                    185.199.111.153
www.mydomain.com  CNAME   1 hour    myaccount.github.io

# ---------------------------
Finally in the GitHub repository "myaccount.github.io"
you create a text file "CNAME" with two lines 

mydomain.com
www.mydomain.com

This is it.
Give it some time - and it should start working.
