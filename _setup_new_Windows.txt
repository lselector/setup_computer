Python - 3 types on installs:

Regular python: 
 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
Anaconda 64-bit Graphical installer:
 - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows 
Miniconda:
 - https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/

Below are docs for anaconda:

Accurately follow instructions for installation: 
 - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ 

Note: install it under your user directory (without admin permissions).
Note: check the checkbox to update PATH
      (by default it is not checked)
Note: anaconda installation should add anaconda to your PATH
      Check it in control panel
      Open the Start Search, 
          type in "env" 
          choose Edit environment variables for your account

Here are paths which are added to User Path:
.;
C:\Users\Youname\anaconda3;
C:\Users\Youname\anaconda3\Library\mingw-w64\bin;
C:\Users\Youname\anaconda3\Library\usr\bin;
C:\Users\Youname\anaconda3\Library\bin;
C:\Users\Youname\anaconda3\Scripts;
C:\Users\Youname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps

Note: you can also add custom PYTHONPATH variable
      and popualte it as needed, for example:  
          .;C:\\Users\\Youname\\py_lib

try the following commands from cmd window

echo %PATH%
python --version
where python
python -c "import pandas as pd;print(pd.__file__)"
where pip
where ipython
ipython --version

ipython
import pandas as pd
pd.__file__

================================================
ipython - set up default profile in home directory

cd C:\Users\Youname
ipython profile create

and add common startup files under
    C:\Users\Youname\.ipython\profile_default\startup

Download them from:
 - https://github.com/lselector/setup_computer
 - https://github.com/lselector/setup_computer/tree/master/ipython_startup

Note: you will probably get Jupyter as part of anaconda python. 
      Try starting using this command:
          jupyter notebook

      Here are separate instructions on how to install 
      and start using the Jupyter notebook on Windows: 
 - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/ 

VSCode is a very good editor to work with python and jupyter.

================================================
python launcher

Python launcher py.exe is a separate executable.
It doesn't come with anaconda python installation.
It is an option you can select if you installing
standard python as described here:

 - https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
 - https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher

It allows you to specify the version of python
you want to use when running the script, 
for example to run old script using python version 2.7 :

   py -2.7 mytest.py

I never use the launcher.
I think in rare case when you need to have several 
versions of python on the same computer 
it is better (cleaner) to keep them in separate 
virtual environments or containers.

================================================
Connecting to remote Linux Server via SSH

Most common Windows application to connect to 
remote unix server is called Putty.

You can download it from here:
   https://www.putty.org/

Instructions on how to use it is here:
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html

Note:
When you create a Linux VM in AWS or Azure, you will
get a private key as a file with extension "pem".
Putty and most other Windows apps can not use PEM format.

Putty needs a file in format "ppk" (Putty Private Key).
You can convert PEM to PPK using "PuTTYgen"
    https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-ppk-pem-conversion/

Usually it is a good idea to create a directory ".ssh"
under your home directory - and keep your keys there.

Note:
It should be also possible to connect via ssh command from terminal.
For example, using "Git Bash" terminal which comes as part
of downloading Git for Windows:
