Installing mysql on mac is easy.
Just google for it.

https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

   (for M1 chip select the ARM version)

I have old intel-based Mac - so I installed this:
    Installed mysql-8.0.28-macos11-x86_64.dmg

Set up root password during the installation.

Or like this (from terminal):
    mysqladmin -u root password YOURNEWPASSWORD

Add the root password into config file in your home directory:

vi ~/.my.cnf

[mysql]
user=root
password=YOURNEWPASSWORD

save - and change permissions:
chmod 0600 .my.cnf

edit ~/.bashrc - add path to mysql executables like this:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin

Restart terminal.
Now you can start mysql prompt with "mysql" command

Once on mysql prompt:

show databases;
create database testdb;
use testdb;
create table t1 ( i1 int null, c1 varchar(80) null );
show tables;
insert into t1 values (1,'a');
insert into t1 values (2,'b');
select * from t1;
exit
